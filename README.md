📖 Overview

JSON Prompt Engineer is a professional-grade prompt engineering tool designed to bridge the gap between human ideas and AI-optimized data structures. It uses Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash model to analyze natural language and generate highly detailed, structured JSON prompts that result in superior output when fed into other LLMs.

Whether you are designing a complex software architecture, planning a marketing campaign, or outlining a novel, this tool ensures your AI instructions are precise, categorized, and actionable.

✨ Key Features

🧠 Intelligent Classification: Automatically detects if your prompt belongs to Software Development, Business Planning, Creative Writing, or Content Creation to tailor the JSON structure.

🎚️ Complexity Toggle:

Basic: Essentials-only for quick concepts.

Precise: Balanced detail including target audience and design styles.

Advanced: Deep technical specs, monetization strategies, and edge-case analysis.

💡 Smart Key Suggestions: After generation, the tool analyzes your JSON and suggests 5-7 additional keys you might have missed to make your prompt even more robust.

✍️ Interactive Editor: Real-time editable JSON output with instant copy-to-clipboard functionality.

🎯 Context Awareness: Optionally provide the "Output Type" (e.g., "Software Spec", "Novel Outline") to steer the AI's structural logic.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: React 19, TypeScript, Vite

Styling: Tailwind CSS

AI Engine: Google Gemini SDK (@google/genai)

Icons: Custom SVG React components (Lucide-inspired)
